# Directory-Size-Calculator
A simple utility script that walks a directory tree and calculates the sizes of files within subdirectories and assesses their age.

Sample usage:

"D:\python>python file_sizes.py C:\Eclipse"

Make sure Python is added to your PATH. Start with "python", add the name of the .py file, then add the target directory. The output file will be created in the same directory as the .py file.
